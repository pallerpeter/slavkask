  "mission_title": "Together against plastic pollution",
  "mission": "In the last three decades, plastic consumption on Earth has quadrupled. Unfortunately, not all plastics can be recycled and this causes a huge problem all over the world, since microplastics have already appeared in our food, water, and even in the human body. It is essential to continuously look for technologies that can be used to process such plastics that cannot be recycled by traditional methods. We strive to create a cross-border cooperation that can reduce plastic pollution and create a cleaner living environment.",
  "mission_summary": "The main task of our non-profit organization is to create an environmentally and socially sustainable world, which can be achieved largely through the utilization of non-recyclable plastics. In addition to our environmental protection activities, our goals include educating the future generation on environmental awareness.",
